Led a gap [assessment](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M5Jo-GpAQE13D6ESgSUPGSFZnTto4udJ/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101134501969411208830&rtpof=true&sd=true) for Fruition Bank to evaluate security controls and create a roadmap to ISO 27001 certification, ensuring the protection of critical financial information.

## The Approach

*   Used the **comprehensive assessment sheet** as the audit program and remediation tracker.
*   Filtered by Status to isolate 'Not Implemented' and 'Partially Implemented' controls.
*   The sheet’s structured columns (Observation, Recommendation, Responsibility, Timeline) directly linked findings to an actionable leadership plan.

## Practical Insights & Recommendations

*   **Access Control & Identity Management:** Shared administrator accounts and inconsistent access reviews undermined accountability. *Recommendation:* Eliminate shared accounts, provision unique credentials, and establish a formal quarterly access review.

*   **User Endpoint Device Protection:** Insufficient anti-malware, weak passwords, and unencrypted endpoints created significant data breach risk. *Recommendation:* Procure adequate endpoint protection, enforce a strong password policy, and implement full-disk encryption.

*   **Secure Disposal of Equipment:** Vendor contracts lacked data sanitisation clauses, posing a major data leakage risk. *Recommendation:* Amend contracts to mandate sanitisation procedures and certificates of destruction.

## Reflection & Learning

The gap assessment’s value lies in its precision and direct link to execution. The single-sheet format transformed it into a clear management tool. 

A future "Control Evidence Pre-Verification" phase would ensure the organisation is truly audit-ready by verifying evidence for each implemented control, de-risking the certification journey.
